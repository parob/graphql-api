> **Complete documentation for GraphQL API, from basic concepts to advanced features.**

Welcome to the GraphQL API documentation! Build powerful GraphQL APIs with Python, from simple schemas to distributed production systems.

## Documentation Overview

The documentation is organized to support your development needs:

### Fundamentals
Start here to understand GraphQL basics and build your first API:

- **[Getting Started](getting-started/)** - Installation and your first GraphQL API
- **[Schema Definition](defining-schemas/)** - Core concepts and decorator patterns
- **[Field Types](field-types/)** - Scalars, collections, and custom types
- **[Object Types & Relationships](object-types/)** - Model complex business entities
- **[Documentation](documentation/)** - Self-documenting schemas with introspection

### Building Applications
Create complete applications with mutations, validation, and error handling:

- **[Input Types & Mutations](mutations/)** - Handle data modifications and validation
- **[Enums & Interfaces](enums-interfaces/)** - Advanced type modeling
- **[Error Handling](error-handling/)** - Robust error management

### Integration & Production
Integrate with your stack and prepare for production deployment:

- **[Pydantic & Dataclasses](pydantic-and-dataclasses/)** - Data validation integration
- **[Async & Subscriptions](async-and-subscriptions/)** - Real-time and async patterns
- **[Middleware](middleware/)** - Authentication, logging, and monitoring
- **[Context & Metadata](context-metadata/)** - Request context and resolver metadata

### Advanced Features
Implement sophisticated patterns and dynamic behavior:

- **[Custom Directives](directives/)** - Schema directives and custom behavior
- **[Schema Filtering](schema-filtering/)** - Dynamic access control
- **[Performance](performance/)** - Optimization techniques and best practices

### Distributed Systems
Build microservices and distributed GraphQL architectures:

- **[Remote GraphQL](remote-graphql/)** - Service integration and remote execution
- **[Federation](federation/)** - Microservices and distributed schemas
- **[Relay Pagination](pagination-relay/)** - Advanced client integration patterns

### Reference & Examples
Complete API documentation and real-world patterns:

- **[Examples](examples/)** - Real-world use cases and patterns
- **[API Reference](api-reference/)** - Complete API documentation
- **[Contributing](contributing/)** - Contribute to the project
